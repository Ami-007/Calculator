# Calculator

Calculator Project-
A project to create a functioning calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript without using the eval() function.

This project was created in order to challenge and cement my understanding of the content I had learned so far in the _nology course.

Features:
This calculator is currently very basic. It can use operators and numbers to do simple calculations and can clear the screen. 

In the future I would like to add the following features:

A delete button that removes the last input from the screen.

A decimal button input for decimal notation.

A percentage button input for working with percentages.

A button to toggle for two different coloured displays (night shift/light shift).

Add an ans button that allows for saving and adding the previous answer button back into a calculation when wanted.
